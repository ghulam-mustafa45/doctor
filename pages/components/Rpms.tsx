                  Our team are RPMS experts and know precisely how to demystify and analyze the data to recommend implementations that empower health system leadership. <br /><br />

                  While RPMS has been around for a long time, HIPAA loves the fact that, to date, hackers have never infiltrated RPMS. Why risk exposure to hackers that love to infiltrate data to hold for ransom?<br /><br />

                  Other systems can cost millions with numerous other expenses, but RPMS is not only free it also has extensive free training and support from IHS.
